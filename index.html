            In the year 2045, the real world is a harsh place, and most of humanity escapes into the OASIS—a virtual reality universe filled with nostalgia, adventure, and infinite possibilities. When the OASIS’s creator dies, he leaves behind a challenge: find three hidden keys to inherit his fortune and control of the OASIS. Young Wade Watts (Parzival) joins the high-stakes hunt and finds himself in a race against a powerful corporation willing to do anything to seize control.
